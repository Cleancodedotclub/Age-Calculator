The "Python Age Calculator" GitHub repository is a simple project that calculates a person's age based on their date of birth. The project is written in Python and utilizes the "tkinter" library for the GUI (graphical user interface).

The user enters their birthdate into the application and clicks the "Calculate Age" button to see their age displayed on the screen. The program also calculates the number of days and seconds the user has been alive.

The code is well-documented and can be easily modified to include additional functionality or to be integrated into other projects. This repository serves as a good starting point for those new to Python or looking to build simple applications using tkinter.
